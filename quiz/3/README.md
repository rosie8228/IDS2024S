## Quiz 3  

1. Name and describe briefly the steps involved in scientific inference.  
Two ways using table and prediction pyramid.  
table: natural phenomena, prediction or observational data, model construction.  
pyramid: prediction, validation, and calibration.   
2. Name the three pillars of science.  
Expirement, Theory, and Computational Model.  
3. Describe three different major applications of the third pillar of science with respect to the first two.  
(Hint: Recall the discussions we had early in the semester during the first lecture series. Where and how could the third pillar replace the other pillars?)  

4. Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide and example of each class.  
Plausible and Deductive.  
5. Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with an example.  
No they are not the same. For example the statement If rain then clouds will not be the same as If clouds then rain because it is an incorrect statement since rain does NOT necessarily always yield clouds, it could be clear skies.  
6. Who is the Boolean algebra named after?  
George Boole.
