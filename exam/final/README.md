# Final Answers  

1. What is the difference between model validation and calibration?  
Model validation is when checking a model is correct, and calibration is when you perform the changes. 
2. what are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
Position, Color, Line type/width, Shape, Size.  
3. Best visualization coloring.  
 Purple to green tones because it is inclusive to color blind people as opposed red and orange colors since those colors just look brown.  
4. Visualization color scales.  
What is each color-scale good for in Data Science?  
n/a  
5. Name the three pillars of science.  
Expirement, Theory, Computational Model  
6. Is logical implication the same as physical causation? Explain with a real-world example.  
No they are not the same. For example the statement If rain then clouds will not be the same as If clouds then rain because it is an incorrect statement since rain does NOT necessarily always yield clouds, it could be clear skies.  
7. Suppose we have fit the following red-line to the following blue dataset representing the global temperature increase of Earth over the past centuries.  
part 1: If the graph were to be more zoomed in then the red-line would be a good addition, but in my opinion the red line should be a slight curved line (expotential) so it can be shown there is a gradual increase.  
part 2: War times occuring so it can alter the data.  
part 3: Negative correlation because increasing heat is not necessarily a good thing.  
part 4: Yes, because it has time as a factor and shows what changes has happend.  
8. Which school(s) of probability theory allow incorporation of expert (prior) knowledge in scientific inference?  
Classical.  
9. When data is scarce, which school of probability theory is the most useful for scientific inference?  
Classical.  
10. Which school of thought in Probability Theory cannot define or discuss the probability of existence of God? Why?  
Frequentist.  
11. A wrong visualization.  
Age cannot start before 0.  
12. Why is everything represented by integers in computers?  
Because computer language is more easy to translate using numbers, such as the ASCII.  
13. Name an ancestor programming language of C.  
B is the ancestor.  
14. Name the first high-level programming language in computer history.  
Fortran.  
15. n/a  
16. n/a    
17. Name the two different categories of logical reasoning and provide and example of each class.   
Deductive and Plausible.  
18. What does it mean if two Boolean propositions are equal?  
 It means that the propositions are equivalent and True.  
19. Omit.  
20. Can we represent all real numbers in computers?  
Yes.  
21. n/a
