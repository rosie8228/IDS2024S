These are my answer to the homework 2 questions.


2. Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer.
3. Because digital computers operate on binary data, which consists of 1s and 0s.
4. Cache memory.
5. Traditional hard disk drive (HDD).
6. bit (binary digit).
7. (A) Assembly language (B) Yes, it requires interpretation or translation into machine code for the computer to execute the instructions. Translation process is done by an assembler.
8. (A) Fortran (B) around 11.5 decades.
9. (A) COBOL (B) Fortran and C are second gen, C++ is third gen, MATLAB and Python and R are fourth gen.
10. C in 1970s, C++ in 1980s, MATLAB in 1970s, Python in 1980s.
11. B is ancestor program language.
12. Simula.
13. Fortran is ancestor for MATLAB, ABC is ancestor for Python.
14. CPU cache memory.
15. Cache line, a fixed-size block of memory used in CPU cache.
16. Register memory is faster than access to RAM by several orders of magnitude.
17. RAM is faster since access times are typically measured in nanoseconds while SSD are measured in microseconds or milliseconds.  
18. Again RAM is measured in nanoseconds and HDD is milliseconds, therefore RAM is faster.
19. The primary role would be acting as switches, amplifiers, and building blocks of digital circuits. They also enable the manipulation and processing logic operators, storing data, and controlling the flow of information within a computer system.
20. It could cause physical constraints, heat dissipation, power consumption, be complex in terms of chip design.
21. Fetch, Decode, Execute.
22. Yes, and this can happen when there are single-threads tasks, inefficient code, thermal throttling.
23. The bottleneck of speed in modern computers varies depending on the specific workload and system configuration. In many cases memory access tends to be a more significant bottleneck due to memory latency, memory bandwidth, cache hierarchy, and memory subsystem efficiency.
24. Dennard Scaling is the historical trend where transistors became smaller while power density remained constant. MOSFET scaling refers to the process of shrinking the transistor sizes to improve performance, reduce power consumption, and increase density. Mooreâ€™s law is an observation made stating that the number of transistors on a microchip double approximately every two years.
25. part 1 (64), part 2 (2080), part 3 (about 0.297 pounds).
26. part 1 (9,223,372,036,854,775,808 grains), part 2 (18,446,744,073,709,551,614 grains), part 3 (2,635,249,152,672,793 pounds of rice), part 4 (1,317,624,576 years).
27. Sequential execution, Conditional Branching, Looping.

Exponential behavior appears a rapidly increasing curve that grows steep over time, a power-law behavior appears as a straight line on a logarithmic scale plot. It also indicates a more gradual increase or decrease in frequency or magnitude.
