1. What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
Position, Color, Line type/width, Shape, Size.  
2. Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
Continuos and Discrete.  
3. Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
Qualitative and Quantitavtive. 
4. What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?  
Categorical. 
5. Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
ordered- stock prices, grades in class, steps to recipe.  
unordered- set of unique email adress, types of fruit.
6. What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
  Quantitative, Numerical, Discrete, Ordered.   
7. What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  
   Axes that represent different things but with the same units and size should be represented in the same unit and size.  
8. Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.  
   An example would be graphing an exponential graph where the growth is slow at first but gets much greater as the time increases. A normal scale y-axis would create lots of difficulties to read the graph as time passes, however, by transforming the y-axis to match the scaling of the graph, it is much more efficient to read it.  
9. Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?  
    All 3 graphs are valid to represent data, however, the information will be hard to read as it gets smaller for the blue graph.  
10. What kind of data set can be best visualized in polar coordinates?  
Polar coordinates are best representing a data set that is periodic where the graph represents the relationship of distance and angle away from a central point.  
11. Name four different color scales and explain their most appropriate usage.  
- Qualitative color scale: to provide strong distinction color for each categories and minimize confusion  
- Categorical color scale: similar to qualitative but mainly focus on assigning color to different category, not in any specific order  
- Sequential color scale: to show changes/ progression in data  
- Diverging color scale: to highlight extreme and midpoint, good for data analyzing and comparison  
12. What is wrong with the following visualization?  
    Age cannot start before 0.
13. The bottom colors with purple to green tones because it is inclusive to color blind people as opposed to the bottom one that would just look all brown to colorblind people.  
14. N/A 
15. N/A  
16. N/A    
17. N/A   
18. Bayesian, frequentist, plausibility, classical.
